# BeaconIndicator

A test application which main purpose is to indicate a distance between a user and an iBeacon. UUID of an iBeacon shall be set manually via code (see `LocationViewModel.swift`), no UI has been made to do simplify this yet.

Also prior to using the code you should install podfile.
